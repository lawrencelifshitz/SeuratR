# SeuratR
test of a private R/rstudio repository which reads private (eventually) data from dropbox.

https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/user_interface.html

The RStudio user interface is automatically enabled if a configuration file for R is detected (i.e. an R version specified in runtime.txt). If this is detected, RStudio will be accessible by appending /rstudio to the URL, like so:

http(s)://<server:port>/rstudio
For example, the following Binder link will open an RStudio session in the R demo repository.

http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/r/master?urlpath=rstudio

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lawrencelifshitz/SeuratR/master  # optionally with ?urlpath=rstudio to get an rstudio session.
